# Node Dependency Injection Framework

A DI framework based on promises that allows components to be constructed asynchronously. 
Components need to specify a list (empty OK) of dependencies. A component will only be 
constructed once all the dependencies are resolved.

## Usage

TODO still, see the tests for examples.
